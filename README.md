# JavaScript-Game

This is a simple javascript game I built to practice my JavaScript Skills.
When you open the html file scroll down and click start game button.
When the game will start there will be a box on the botton which you will be able to move left and right with keyboard keys.
There will be coins falling from the sky and you to catch the coins with the ball.
Each coin caught will add 1 to your score.
There will be also red ball you have to prevent hitting your box. If the red ball will hit your box the game will be over
